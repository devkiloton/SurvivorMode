- Survivor Mode is basically a game where the protagonist tries to survive after a zombie apocalypse as long as he can. To do that, you will need to control him and kill the biggest number of zombies as you can!

# Why? 

- This project is my first game and it is a result of some months studying logic programming, C#,  Unity Framework and the Unity Engine. Here the objective was to do a simple game to introduce me in the world of 3D game developing e apply my C# knowledge!

- Also, you can use this project as you wish, be for study or commercial use. Just be careful with the arts, the sounds and their royalties! 

- Any ideas or suggestions:
